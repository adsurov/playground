# FizzBuzz

Write a function called `fizzBuzz` that takes a number `n` as an argument and returns an array of strings.

The function should do the following:

1. For numbers from 1 to n (inclusive):
   - If the number is divisible by 3, add "Fizz" to the array.
   - If the number is divisible by 5, add "Buzz" to the array.
   - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, add "FizzBuzz" to the array.
   - If the number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, add the number itself as a string to the array.

2. Return the resulting array.

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]

Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]

Example 3:

Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]
